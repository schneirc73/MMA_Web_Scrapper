# MMA_Web_Scrapper-Data-Cleaning
Web Scrapper Code used to pull information on UFC fights that will be used to predict the outcomes in a future project.  The cleaning part of this project is currently being worked on, I will explain the data manipulation more in depth when I am able to upload the code...

*** The idea of accurate predictions of sports, in my mind comes with the notion of a model being able to accurately predict the outcome of an event with the metrics that both fighters recorded in the fight.  If I am able to produce a model that can predict along these lines then predicting future events should be possible.  I am working on this thought train currently and will upload the code when I am finished with it.
